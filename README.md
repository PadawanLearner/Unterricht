# Unterricht

The plan of this app changed from a Quizlet-like app, to something much more brief for convenient learning.

Essentially the new idea is to have a daily review of useful shortcuts and commands for Linux, Vim, etc.  The daily shortcuts tips will change every night at midnight, and will be referred to as "The Daily."  I hope to add other neat features to The Daily.
